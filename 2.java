Hi , I have created my git account and i have started practice on it.
And i know oneday i will be expert in it with in 5 days.
Now I have created a branch and i am in win branch.

Branches are created for seperate development if there is any bug or issues are arises. Because a developer can never start fixing the issue in same master branch.
He need to create the seperate branch.

this is a part of the merge confilct , so i m editing the file in this also.
