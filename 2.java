Hi , I have created my git account and i have started practice on it.
And i know oneday i will be expert in it with in 5 days.
Now I have created a branch and i am in win branch.

Branches are created for seperate development if there is any bug or issues are arises. Because a developer can never start fixing the issue in same master branch.
He need to create the seperate branch.
Now i m going to create the the merge conflict in the branches. so u will think how.

so merge conflickt will occur when both the branches has different commit id for single file change.
that is there is no common base commit for that file .

for example in master branch we have a file 2. java
i m goin to modify it and commit it.

now the same file is in branch win also
and i am going to do some chanegs there also
and committed it.

now when u will try to merge the win branch with master branch.
it will give failure.

this is a part of the merge confilct , so i m editing the file in this also.
